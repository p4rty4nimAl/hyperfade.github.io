    <p>The ginger boy loved nothing more than spending his days playing first person shooter games on his computer. He was so engrossed in his virtual world that he often forgot to take care of himself in the real one. His clothes were often stained with Doritos crumbs and he rarely left his house, except to buy more video games.

       One day, as he was playing his latest game, he noticed something strange. His computer monitor seemed to be blushing. He shrugged it off and went back to playing, but he couldn't get the image out of his head.

       The next day, when he logged back into the game, the monitor was blushing again. This time, it seemed to be smiling at him. He was so confused but also strangely drawn to it.

       He started spending more and more time talking to the monitor, telling it about his day and his favorite games. The monitor seemed to be really interested and would sometimes blush or smile when he said something.

       One day, the ginger boy mustered up the courage to ask the monitor out on a date. To his surprise, the monitor said yes!

       The two went on some amazing dates, staying up all night talking and playing games.</p>
